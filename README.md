# Prediction of Readmittance of Diabetic Patients using analysis of HbA1c value
This project is a part of the coursework of Analytics System Technology (AST) at Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA.

#### -- Project Status: [Active, On-Hold, Completed]

## Project Intro/Objective
The topic and dataset that I have chosen is to baseline the care strategies used at hospital to cure the diabetic patients. Our study has included the dataset from the Health Fact database, being a national data warehouse that contains comprehensive data from across the United States.
The analysis of the test HbA1c will be very significant as this would set a baseline for the change during the hospitalization of the patients. The values of HbA1c were considered during the time of admission of inpatient, outpatients, and emergency.
The purpose of this project is to find out the early readmissions of diabetic patients and factors playing role in it.
